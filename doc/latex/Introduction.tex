\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

\textbf{AtChem2} is an open source modelling tool for atmospheric
chemistry. It is designed to build and run zero-dimensional
box-models using the Master Chemical Mechanism
(\href{https://mcm.york.ac.uk/MCM}{MCM}). The \textbf{MCM} is a
near-explicit chemical mechanism which describes the gas-phase
oxidation of primary emitted Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) to
carbon dioxide (\cf{CO2}) and water (\cf{H2O}). The MCM protocol is
detailed in \citet{jenkin_1997} and subsequent updates
\citep{saunders_2003, jenkin_2003, bloss_2005, jenkin_2012, jenkin_2015}.
AtChem2 is designed for use with the MCM, but it is able to use any
other chemical mechanism, as long as it is in the correct format
(Sect.~\ref{sec:chemical-mechanism}).

AtChem2 is a development of \textbf{AtChem-online}, a modelling web
tool created at the University of Leeds to facilitate the use of the
MCM in the simulation of laboratory and environmental chamber
experiments within the \href{https://www.eurochamp.org}{EUROCHAMP}
community \citep{martin_2009}. AtChem-online runs as a
\href{https://atchem.york.ac.uk}{web service}, provided by the
University of York: in order to use AtChem-online, the user needs only
a text editor, a file compression tool, a web browser, and an internet
connection. A tutorial -- with examples and exercises -- is available on
the \href{https://mcm.york.ac.uk/MCM/atchemonline/intro}{MCM website}.

AtChem-online is easy to use even for inexperienced users but has a
number of limitations, mostly related to its nature as a web
application. \textbf{AtChem2} was developed from AtChem-online; the
aim is to provide an \emph{offline} modelling tool capable of running
long simulations of computationally intensive models, as well as batch
simulations (e.g., for sensitivity studies). In addition, AtChem2
implements a continuous integration workflow, along with a
comprehensive Testsuite and a version control workflow (with
\href{https://git-scm.com}{git}), which makes it robust, reliable and
traceable.

The codebase of AtChem2 is structured into four components (or layers,
see Fig.~\ref{fig:atchem-arch}) and is written in Fortran 90/95.
Installation, compilation and execution of AtChem2 are semi-automated
via a number of shell and Python scripts that require minimal input
from the user. Model configuration and inputs consist of simple text
files that can be easily modified with any text editor.

This document (\texttt{AtChem2-Manual.pdf}) is the AtChem2 user manual
and contains all the information required to install, configure, and
use the current version of the model. The AtChem2
\href{https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/wiki}{wiki} contains summaries
of these instructions for quick user reference; additional
information, such as example submission scripts for HPC systems
(Sect.~\ref{subsec:hpc}), and guidance for resolving some
\underline{known issues} are also available on the wiki.

\textbf{AtChem-tools} is a set of Python tools designed to be used with AtChem2,
available in the \href{https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem-tools}{related repository}.
The tools are written in Python and include scripts to help with the model setup 
and configuration, to run the model, and to analyze the model outputs.

\section{Conventions} \label{sec:conventions}

The following conventions are adopted in the AtChem2 user manual and
documentation:

\begin{description}
\item[\maindir] is the base directory of the AtChem2 model.\\
  For example: \texttt{\$HOME/AtChem2/}.
\item[\depdir] is the directory where the AtChem2 dependencies are installed.\\
  For example: \texttt{\$HOME/AtChem-lib/}.
\item[\sharedir] is the directory for the pre-compiled chemical
  mechanism shared library (\texttt{mechanism.so}).\\
  By default, it is \texttt{model/configuration/} inside the \maindir.
\end{description}

The user can change the locations and names of these directories
according to their setup, workflow, personal preferences, etc\ldots As
long as the correct paths to the libraries and directories needed by
AtChem2 are specified, the model will compile and run.\\

\textcolor{red}{\bf Important Note}: AtChem2 runs in
\textbf{Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)}, with no daylight
saving. This is to simplify the calculation of the solar angles and,
therefore, of the photolysis rates (Sect.~\ref{sec:photolysis-rates}).
The user must ensure that the input data and the model constraints are
provided in UTC (i.e. GMT timezone) and convert the output to Local
Time, if needed.
