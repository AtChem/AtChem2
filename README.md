AtChem2  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AtChem/AtChem2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AtChem/AtChem2)  [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AtChem/AtChem2/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/AtChem/AtChem2)
=======


**AtChem2** is an atmospheric chemistry box-model, primarily designed for use with the **Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM)**, a near-explicit chemical mechanism which describes the gas-phase oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the lower atmosphere. The MCM can be found at http://mcm.york.ac.uk/ (previously at http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/). The latest stable release of AtChem2 can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/releases).

AtChem2 is _open source_, under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

**_Please see `CITATION.md` for information on how to cite the model in publications._**

Installation, Setup and Execution
---------------------------------

AtChem2 requires a Fortran compiler (GNU `gfortran` or Intel `ifort`), the **CVODE** library (part of the [SUNDIALS suite](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials)), **openlibm** and **Python**. Compilation of CVODE also requires **cmake**, and the Fortran libraries **BLAS** and **LAPACK**. Optionally, **numdiff**, **FRUIT**, and **Ruby** are required to run the _test suite_.

AtChem2 compiles and runs on Unix/Linux and macOS systems. From the main directory, copy and rename the file `tools/install/Makefile.skel` to `./Makefile`. Edit `./Makefile` to set the variables `CVODELIB`, `OPENLIBMDIR` and `FRUITDIR` to the paths of CVODE, openlibm and (if installed) FRUIT. A working knowledge of the unix shell is required to install and use AtChem2.

From the main directory, execute:
```
./build/build_atchem2.sh mcm/mechanism_test.fac model/configuration/ mcm/
```
to compile AtChem2 using the example chemical mechanism (in FACSIMILE format) and a default model configuration. The build script converts the chemical mechanism from the FACSIMILE format (`.fac`) to a Fortran compatible format and generates the shared library `mechanism.so` and other related files in the `model/configuration/` directory. At completion of the build process an executable file called `atchem2` is created in the main directory.

Set the initial conditions, the required outputs and the other model parameters by editing the files in the `model/configuration/` directory. If required, copy the constraints files into the relevant directory in `model/constraints/`. To run the model, execute:
```./atchem2```

The build script and the `atchem2` executable accept several command line arguments to customize the location of the configuration, input and output directories, and of the shared library. More information on AtChem2, and detailed instructions on its installation, configuration and use can be found in the manual (`doc/AtChem2-Manual.pdf`). A summary of the main commands and additional information is available on the [AtChem2 wiki](https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/wiki).
