The `tools/` directory contains a number of auxiliary scripts to install, build and compile AtChem2, and to plot the results of the model:

* shell script to compile the model: `build.sh`.
* Python scripts to process the chemical mechanism: `fix_mechanism_fac.py`, `mech_converter.py`.
* Python scripts to enforce a consistent [[coding style|3.2 Style Guide]]: `fix_indent.py`, `fix_style.py`.
* Ruby script to run the unit tests: `fruit_generator.rb`.
* example chemical mechanism in FACSIMILE format: `mcm_example.fac`.
* `install/` directory containing scripts to install the [[dependencies|1.1 Dependencies]].
* `plot/` directory containing scripts to plot the model results.

In addition, the `tools/` directory contains a copy of the `Makefile`, which has to be copied to the _main directory_ and modified as explained in the [[installation page|1. Installation]].

## Plot tools

The plotting scripts in `tools/plot/` are only intended to give a quick view of the model results. It is suggested to use a proper data analysis software (e.g., R, Octave/MATLAB, Igor, Origin, etc...) to process and analyze the model results. The scripts are written in various programming languages, but they all produce the same output: a file called `atchem2_output.pdf` in the given directory (e.g., `model/output/`).

From the _main directory_:

    gnuplot -c tools/plot/plot-atchem2.gp model/output/
    octave tools/plot/plot-atchem2.m model/output/
    python tools/plot/plot-atchem2.py model/output/
    Rscript --vanilla tools/plot/plot-atchem2.r model/output/

_N.B._: the matlab script (`plot-atchem2.m`) is compatible with both Octave and MATLAB. GNU Octave is an open-source implementation of MATLAB.
