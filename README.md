AtChem2  [![CI](https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
=======


**AtChem2** is a modelling tool for atmospheric chemistry. It is primarily designed to use the **Master Chemical Mechanism** (MCM), but it can be used with any general set of chemical reactions. The MCM is a near-explicit chemical mechanism which describes the gas-phase oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the lower atmosphere. The MCM is available at http://mcm.york.ac.uk/.

AtChem2 is _open source_, under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

**_Please see `CITATION.md` for information on how to cite the model in publications._**


Directory structure
-------------------

- `build/` contains the Python and shell scripts used to compile AtChem2.
- `doc/` contains the AtChem2 user manual, with the LaTeX source files, and the poster presented at the [ACM 2018 conference](https://acm.aqrc.ucdavis.edu).
- `mcm/` contains data files related to specific versions of the MCM and an example chemical mechanism (in FACSIMILE format).
- `model/` contains an example directory structure for the chemical mechanism, model configuration, constraints and output. There can be several such directories (with different names).
- `obj/` contains the files generated by the Fortran compiler.
- `src/` contains the Fortran source files.
- `tests/` contains the Test Suite scripts and files.
- `tools/` contains shell scripts to install AtChem2 and its dependencies, plotting scripts in various languages, and other utilities.


Installation, Setup and Execution
---------------------------------

AtChem2 requires a **Fortran** compiler (GNU `gfortran` or Intel `ifort`), the **CVODE** (part of [SUNDIALS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials)) and **openlibm** libraries, **make**, and **Python**. Compilation of CVODE also requires **cmake**. Optionally, **numdiff**, **FRUIT**, and **Ruby** are required to run the Test Suite. AtChem2 compiles and runs on Unix/Linux and macOS systems. A working knowledge of the **unix shell** is required to install and use AtChem2.

The latest stable version of AtChem2 can be downloaded from the [Releases page](https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/releases). After installing the required dependencies using the scripts in the `tools/install/` directory, copy the file `tools/install/Makefile.skel` to the _Main Directory_ and rename it `Makefile`. Set the variables `CVODELIB`, `OPENLIBMDIR` and `FRUITDIR` in `Makefile` to the paths of CVODE, openlibm and (if installed) FRUIT. To compile the model using the example chemical mechanism, execute the command:

```
./build/build_atchem2.sh ./mcm/mechanism_test.fac
```

The build script converts the chemical mechanism from the FACSIMILE format (`mechanism_test.fac`) to a Fortran-compatible format, and generates the shared library `mechanism.so` in the `model/configuration/` directory. After the build process is completed, an executable file called `atchem2` is created in the _Main Directory_.

Set the initial conditions, the required outputs and the other model parameters by editing the files in the `model/configuration/` directory. If required, copy the constraint files to the relevant subdirectory in `model/constraints/`. To run the model with the default configuration, execute the command:

```./atchem2```

The `atchem2` executable accepts several command line arguments to customize the location of the configuration, input and output directories, and of the shared library. More information on AtChem2, and detailed instructions on its installation, configuration and use can be found in the manual (`doc/AtChem2-Manual.pdf`) and in the GMD paper (see `CITATION.md`).

The [AtChem2 wiki](https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/wiki) contains a summary of the instructions to install, compile, run and contribute to the development of Atchem2, together with additional information, a list of [known issues](https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/wiki/Known-Issues), and the suggested solutions or workarounds.
