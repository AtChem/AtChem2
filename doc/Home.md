**AtChem2** is a modelling software designed to build and run atmospheric chemistry box-models using the Master Chemical Mechanism ([MCM](http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM/)). It can also be used with other chemical mechanisms, as long as they are provided in the FACSIMILE format (see [[2.1 Chemical Mechanism]]).

AtChem2 was developed from **AtChem-online** (https://atchem.leeds.ac.uk/webapp/) with the objective to create a software able to run large atmospheric chemistry models. AtChem-online is a web tool developed at the University of Leeds as part of the [EUROCHAMP project](https://www.eurochamp.org/). It was designed to facilitate the use of the MCM in the simulation of environmental chamber experiments. A tutorial for AtChem-online, with examples and exercises, is available on the [MCM website](http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCMv3.3.1/atchem/tutorial_intro.htt). A help page with detailed instructions and description of the model parameters and variables is available [here](https://atchem.leeds.ac.uk/webapp/run/help.html).
