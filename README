This directory contains sources of the AtChem application. The tools directory contains scripts for building the AtChem executable for a given input, while the travis directory contains the testsuite files.

*******************************
* Dependencies
*******************************

AtChem requires a working Fortran compiler, BLAS and LAPACK libraries, CVODE library, and a Python 2 installation. Running the testsuite additionally requires a numdiff installation.

Please refer to https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem/wiki/Dependencies for installation instructions of these dependencies.

******************************
* Building AtChem
******************************

Please refer to https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem/wiki/Installation for installation instructions. Very briefly:

Run make makefile.local and set the variable CVODELIB to the location of the CVODE libraries. Type "./tools/build.sh mcm_subset.fac" in the top-level directory and this should create an executable atchem file. This is for a default configuration. Run by typing "./atchem".

******************************
* Converting FACSMILE to AtChem
******************************

The build.sh script in the tools directory is sufficient to convert a .fac file to a format usable by AtChem. This makes use of the underlying scripts setup_atchem.py, fix_mechanism_fac.py, and mech_converter.py

******************************
* Running AtChem
******************************

After making placing your configuration files in modelConfiguration, run "tools/build.sh" in the top-level directory of AtChem sources, with argument pointing to a the input .fac file, and then run "./atchem". Output files should appear in modelOutput and instantaneousRates, although these are also configurable.
