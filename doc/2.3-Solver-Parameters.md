The **solver parameters** are set in the text file `model/configuration/solver.parameters`; they control the behaviour of the ordinary differential equations (ODE) solver. A complete explanation of these parameters can be found in the [CVODE documentation](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software).

- **atol** (positive real) and **rtol** (positive real): absolute and relative tolerance values for the solver. Standard values for these parameters are listed below, for reference.

- **delta main** (positive real): linear convergence tolerance factor of the GMRES linear solver.

- **lookback** (positive integer): maximum Krylov subspace dimension of the GMRES linear solver.

- **maximum solver step size** (positive real): maximum size (in seconds) of the timesteps that the solver is allowed to use.

- **maximum number of steps in solver** (positive integer): maximum number of steps used by the solver before reaching **tout**, the next output time.

- **solver type** (integer): selects the linear solver to use: `1` for GMRES, `2` for GMRES preconditioned with a banded preconditioner, `3` for a dense solver. The default option is `2`.

- **banded preconditioner upper bandwidth** (integer): used in the case that `solver type = 2`.

- **banded preconditioner lower bandwidth** (integer): used in the case that `solver type = 2`.
