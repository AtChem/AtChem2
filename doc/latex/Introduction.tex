\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

\textbf{AtChem2} is an open source modelling tool for atmospheric
chemistry. It is designed to build and run zero-dimensional
box-models using the Master Chemical Mechanism
(\href{https://mcm.york.ac.uk/MCM}{MCM}). The \textbf{MCM} is a
near-explicit chemical mechanism which describes the gas-phase
oxidation of primary emitted Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) to
carbon dioxide (\cf{CO2}) and water (\cf{H2O}). The MCM protocol is
detailed in \citet{jenkin_1997} and subsequent updates
\citep{saunders_2003, jenkin_2003, bloss_2005, jenkin_2012, jenkin_2015}.
Although it is meant to be used with the MCM, AtChem2 can use any
other chemical mechanism, as long as it is in the correct format
(Sect.~\ref{sec:chemical-mechanism}).

AtChem2 is a development of \textbf{AtChem-online}, a modelling web
tool created at the University of Leeds to facilitate the use of the
MCM in the simulation of laboratory and environmental chamber
experiments within the \href{https://www.eurochamp.org}{EUROCHAMP}
community \citep{martin_2009}. AtChem-online runs as a
\href{https://atchem.york.ac.uk}{web service}, provided by the
University of York: in order to use AtChem-online, the user needs only
a text editor, a file compression tool, a web browser, and an internet
connection. A tutorial -- with examples and exercises -- is available on
the \href{https://mcm.york.ac.uk/MCM/atchemonline/intro}{MCM website}.

AtChem-online is easy to use even for inexperienced users but has a
number of limitations, mostly related to its nature as a web
application. \textbf{AtChem2} was developed from AtChem-online; the
aim is to provide an \emph{offline} modelling tool capable of running
long simulations of computationally intensive models, as well as batch
simulations for sensitivity studies. In addition, AtChem2 implements a
continuous integration workflow, coupled with a comprehensive
Testsuite and version control (\href{https://git-scm.com}{git}) which
makes it robust, reliable and traceable.

The codebase of AtChem2 is structured into four components (or layers)
-- as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:atchem-arch} -- and is written
mostly in Fortran 90/95. Installation, compilation and execution of
AtChem2 are semi-automated via a number of shell and Python scripts
that require minimal input from the user. This document
(\texttt{AtChem2-Manual.pdf}) is the AtChem2 user manual and contains
all the information required to install, configure, and use the
current version of AtChem2. A summary of these instructions, with
additional information and a list of \emph{known issues}, can be found
on the \href{https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/wiki}{AtChem2 wiki}.

\section{Conventions} \label{sec:conventions}

The following conventions are adopted in the AtChem2 user manual and
documentation:

\begin{description}
\item[\maindir] is the base directory of the AtChem2 model.\\
  For example: \texttt{\$HOME/AtChem2/}.
\item[\depdir] is the directory where the AtChem2 dependencies are installed.\\
  For example: \texttt{\$HOME/AtChem-lib/}.
\item[\sharedir] is the directory for the chemical mechanism shared
  library (\texttt{mechanism.so}).\\
  By default, it is \texttt{model/configuration/} in the \maindir.
\end{description}

The user can change the locations and names of these directories
according to their setup, workflow, personal preferences, etc\ldots As
long as the correct paths to the libraries and directories needed by
AtChem2 are specified, the model will compile and run.\\

\textcolor{red}{\bf Important Note}: AtChem2 runs in
\textbf{Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)}, with no daylight
saving. This is to simplify the calculation of the solar angles and,
therefore, of the photolysis rates. The user must ensure that the
input data and the model constraints are provided in UTC (i.e. GMT
timezone) and convert the output to Local Time, if needed.
