# This script corrects the content of a chemical mechanism file in
# FACSIMILE format (.fac) by removing incorrect newline characters.
#
# Due to a bug of the extraction tool on the MCM website, sometimes
# the newline character is inserted in the wrong place. For example:
#
#   % 3.8D-13*EXP(780/TEMP)*(1-1/(1+498*EXP(-1160/TEMP))) : CH3O2 + HO2 =
#   CH3OOH ; % 3.8D-13*EXP(780/TEMP)*(1/(1+498*EXP(-1160/TEMP))) : CH3O2 + HO2 =
#   HCHO ;
#   % 2.3D-12*EXP(360/TEMP)*0.001 : CH3O2 + NO = CH3NO3 ;
#
# This may cause issues during the conversion to Fortran format by
# mech_converter.py. The script fixes these errors, if present, and
# returns the chemical mechanism properly formatted, e.g.:
#
#   % 3.8D-13*EXP(780/TEMP)*(1-1/(1+498*EXP(-1160/TEMP))) : CH3O2 + HO2 = CH3OOH ;
#   % 3.8D-13*EXP(780/TEMP)*(1/(1+498*EXP(-1160/TEMP))) : CH3O2 + HO2 = HCHO ;
#   % 2.3D-12*EXP(360/TEMP)*0.001 : CH3O2 + NO = CH3NO3 ;
#
# ARGUMENT:
#   1. path to the mechanism .fac file
