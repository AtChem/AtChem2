The **environment variables** define the physical parameters of the box-model, such as temperature, pressure, humidity, latitude, longitude, position of the sun, etc... These variables are set in the text file `model/configuration/environmentVariables.config`. 

The environment variables can have a fixed (constant) value or can be constrained to measured values (`CONSTRAINED`), in which case the corresponding data file must be in the `model/constraints/environment/` directory (see [[2.7 Constraints]]). Some environment variables can be calculated by the model (`CALC`) and some can be deactivated if they are not used by the model (`NOTUSED`).

By default, most environment variables are set to a fixed value, corresponding to _standard environmental conditions_ (listed below), or to `NOTUSED`.

## TEMP

Ambient Temperature (K).

* fixed value
* constrained

Default fixed value = 298.15

## PRESS

Ambient Pressure (mbar).

* fixed value
* constrained

Default fixed value = 1013.25

## RH

Relative Humidity (%). It is required only if **H2O** is set to `CALC`, otherwise should be set to `NOTUSED`.

* fixed value
* constrained
* not used

Default = NOTUSED (-1)

## H2O

Water Concentration (molecules cm-3).

* fixed value
* constrained
* calculated -> requires **RH** set to fixed value or `CONSTRAINED`

Default fixed value = 3.91e+17

## DEC

Sun Declination (radians) is the angle between the center of the Sun and Earth's equatorial plane.

* fixed value
* constrained
* calculated -> requires **DAY** and **MONTH**, which are set in `model.parameters` (see [[2.2 Model Parameters]])

Default fixed value = 0.41

## BLHEIGHT

Boundary Layer Height. It is required only if the model includes emission or deposition processes (it must be used in the chemical mechanism as a multiplier of the rate coefficient). The unit is typically in cm, but it depends on how the processes are parameterized in the chemical mechanism (see [[2.1 Chemical Mechanism]]).

* fixed value
* constrained
* not used

Default = NOTUSED (-1)

## DILUTE

Dilution rate. It is required only if the model includes a dilution process (it must be used in the chemical mechanism as a multiplier of the rate coefficient). The unit is typically in s-1, but it depends on how the process is parameterized in the chemical mechanism (see [[2.1 Chemical Mechanism]]).

* fixed value
* constrained
* not used

Default value = NOTUSED  (-1)

## JFAC

Correction factor used to correct the photolysis rates (e.g., to account for cloudiness). The calculated photolysis rates are scaled by JFAC, which can have a value between `0` (photolysis rates go to zero) and `1` (photolysis rates are not corrected). JFAC is NOT applied to constant or constrained photolysis rates. For more information go to: [[2.5 Photolysis Rates and JFAC]].

* fixed value
* constrained
* calculated

Default fixed value = 1

## ROOF

Flag to turn the photolysis rates ON/OFF. It is used in simulations of environmental chamber experiments, where the roof of the chamber can be opened/closed or the lights turned on/off.

When ROOF is set to `CLOSED` all the photolysis rates are zero, including those that are constant or constrained; this is different than setting JFAC to `0`, which only applies to the calculated photolysis rates (see above). ROOF is the only environment variable that cannot be set to `CONSTRAINED`.

Default value = OPEN
