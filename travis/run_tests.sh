# The basic workflow of this function is to loop over each test in $1, and for
# each test, compare the screen output and the other output files with previously held results.
# A mismatch generates a test failure. Numdiff is used to cope with small numerical
# differences due to differing hardware, OS, and package versions.
#
# $2 is used to pass CVODELIB in from Makefile, in order to be able to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on macOS.
#
# $this_test_failures is used to keep a track of whether each test is passing: empty indicates
# a pass, while non-empty indicates a failure.
# $this_file_failures holds the output of the numdiff for each file
#
# We also allow some lines of the screen output to be skipped - e.g. the runtime line,
#Â since this is machine-dependent. Multiple such lines can be skipped by appending to
# $skip_test. This requires extra machinery to handle splitting the file into
# sections between the skipped lines, and to numdiff those sections.
