\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

\textbf{AtChem2} is a modelling software designed to build and run
atmospheric chemistry box-models using the Master Chemical Mechanism
(\href{http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM/}{MCM}). It can also be used with
other chemical mechanisms, as long as they are provided in the
FACSIMILE format (see \hyperref[sec:mechanism]{Chemical Mechanism}).

AtChem2 was developed from \textbf{AtChem-online} with the objective
to create a software able to run large atmospheric chemistry
models. \href{https://atchem.leeds.ac.uk/webapp/}{AtChem-online} is a
web tool developed at the University of Leeds as part of the
\href{https://www.eurochamp.org/}{EUROCHAMP project}. It was designed
to facilitate the use of the MCM in the simulation of environmental
chamber experiments. A tutorial for AtChem-online, with examples and
exercises, is available on the
\href{http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCMv3.3.1/atchem/tutorial_intro.htt}{MCM
  website}. A help page with detailed instructions and description of
the model parameters and variables is available
\href{https://atchem.leeds.ac.uk/webapp/run/help.html}{here}.

The latest stable version of Atchem2 can be found at the
\href{https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/releases}{releases page}. The
development version can be downloaded from the
\href{https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/archive/master.zip}{master
  branch} or obtained via \textbf{git}. To install and run AtChem2
follow the instructions on the \hyperref[sec:install]{Installation}
and \hyperref[sec:dependencies]{Dependencies} pages.

AtChem2 is open source, under \textbf{MIT license}. For instructions
on how to cite the model in publications, see the \texttt{CITATION.md}
file. The contributors and funders of \textbf{AtChem-online} and
\textbf{AtChem2} are listed in the
\hyperref[ch:credits]{Acknowledgements and Credits} chapter.

Bug reports, suggestions and contributions are welcome. In order to
contribute to the model development, please follow the instructions in
the corresponding \hyperref[ch:development]{Model Development}
chapter.
