This directory contains sources of the AtChem2 application. The tools directory contains scripts for building the AtChem2 executable for a given input, while the travis directory contains the testsuite files. The remaining subdirectories are empty, but provide a default location for input and output files.

**********************************
* Dependencies
**********************************

AtChem2 requires a working Fortran compiler, BLAS and LAPACK libraries, CVODE library, openlibm library, and a Python 2 installation. Running the testsuite additionally requires a numdiff installation.

Please refer to https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/wiki/1.1-Dependencies for installation instructions of these dependencies.

**********************************
* Building AtChem2
**********************************

Please refer to https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/wiki/1.-Installation for installation instructions. Very briefly:

After having installed all dependencies, please note that at present AtChem2 requires recompilation for each new .fac file. This is all handled by the script "./tools/build.sh", which converts the .fac file into a format usable by AtChem2 (namely, it generates two Fortran files and several data files).

Firstly, run make makefile.local and set the variable CVODELIB inside makefile.local to the location of the CVODE libraries. Type "./tools/build.sh tools/mcm_example.fac" in the top-level directory and this should create an executable name "atchem2". This is for a default configuration. Run by typing "./atchem2".

**********************************
* Configuring and running AtChem2
**********************************

AtChem2 accepts several command line arguments to configure the location of output and input files, with defaults also defined if not provided. After following the build step above, run "./atchem2".
